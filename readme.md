## Windows iCloud Auto Backup

#### This is a simple script for adding new files from the documents folder and downloads folder to an iCloud drive folder in Windows 10. I created it because my father wanted to be able to access more current versions of his documents and downloads folders from his iPad and to have those two folders backed up. It is set to run on an interval using Windows' Task Schduler.
